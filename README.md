👋 Hi, I’m Ale Solda!

💻 I'm a developer. I've been working with Python 🐍 for the last years, most of the time working as a backend developer.

💝 I enjoy building Python backends and microservices with Docker, Kubernetes, and APIs, especially when it involves automation and scalability.

👀 Pss, I have authored several _commits_ and _pull requests_ in the well-known Python [Celery](https://github.com/celery/celery) library to provide you with a sense of my work:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 👉 https://github.com/celery/celery/pulls?q=is:pr+author:alesolda

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 👉 https://github.com/celery/celery/commits?author=alesolda

Otherwise, I suggest checking out one of my past challenge projects, e.g.:
